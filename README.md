# host-dynamics

This folder serves as the online repository for force-field parameters of macrocyclic hosts investigated in our recent host-dynamics work, the full text of which can be accessed freely at https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/642fdd060784a63aeeafdc83. 

The parameter files for macrocyclic hosts under refitting are provided. For bonded and vdW parameters, the GAFF, GAFF2 and refitted FM-B97-3c parameter sets are employed. Term-specific comparison for these host molecules under the two GAFF versions has been provided in the main article. The atomic charges in the prmtop files are from RESP fitting with the HF/6-31G* ESP, following the traition and being consistent with the main-stream practice. Due to the L2 regularization employed in refitting, the initial guess has some impacts. Thus, the refitting is repeated with both GAFF and GAFF2.
